# CS 2200 Cache Simulator
Copyright (c) 2017, Ctrl+Alt+Delicious

This application serves as an educational tool to help users visualize and understand the inner workings of a [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)). It was primarily built to aid students taking the Introduction to Computer Systems and Networks (CS 2200) course at the Georgia Institute of Technology, but can surely act as a great resource for anyone struggling with the concept of a cache.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for usage.

### Prerequisites

##### Windows

##### MacOS
Install Homebrew - the package manager for Mac, open the terminal and type
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

brew install node
```
After running these commands have completed, run the following two commands in the terminal to verify a successful installation, you should see the current version number appear like so:
```
node -v

```
```
npm -v
>> 4.5.0
```
##### Linux
### Installing
